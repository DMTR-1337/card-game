# Card Game

A Card game, where the **player** is dealt two cards and the **computer** opponent is dealt two cards. 
After this, the user is given more cards if he wants to draw them.
The **computer** never draws more cards. The one who gets closer to **21** wins. 
The cards are drawn one at a time as long as the **player** wants to keep his count to exceed **21**.
